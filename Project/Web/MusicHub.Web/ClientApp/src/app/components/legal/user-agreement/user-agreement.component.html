  <p>Hello, and welcome to the MusicHub Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”). The Terms you see below are important because they:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Outline your legal rights on MusicHub</li>
    <li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use MusicHub</li>
    <li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using MusicHub</li>
    <li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement on how to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully. We hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.</p>

  <p>Here we go…</p>

  <h2>1 Introduction</h2>

  <p>Thanks for choosing MusicHub (“MusicHub,” “we,” “us,” “our”). MusicHub provides personalised services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time. By signing up or otherwise using any of these MusicHub services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “MusicHub Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with the MusicHub entity indicated in Section 25 (Contact us).</p>

  <p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree
  to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third
  parties (collectively, the “Agreements”). The Agreements include terms regarding
  future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability,
  privacy, waiver of class actions,
  and resolution of disputes by arbitration
  instead of in court. If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements,
  the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on MusicHub’s
  website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements,
  and agree to be bound by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then
  you may not use the MusicHub Service or access any Content.</p>

  <p>
    In order to use the MusicHub Service and access any Content, you need to (1) meet the age requirements in the chart below, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in a country where Service is available. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to MusicHub is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
    If you are a resident of one of the following countries, reference this chart for your country-specific age restrictions:
  </p>



  <h2>2 Changes to the Agreements</h2>

  <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements for valid reasons, such as improving the existing
  functions or features or adding new functions or features to the Service, implementing advancements in
  science and technology, and reasonable technical adjustments to the Service, ensuring the operability or
  the security of the Service, and for legal or regulatory reasons. When we make material changes to the
  Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a
  prominent notice or seeking your agreement within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases,
  we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will
  constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.
 

  <h2>3 Enjoying MusicHub</h2>

  <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy MusicHub.</p>

  <h3>3.1 Service Options</h3>

  <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a MusicHub account. Certain options are provided to you free-of-charge.  The MusicHub Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.”  Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the MusicHub Service. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.</p>

  <p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.</p>

  <p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of MusicHub for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions. You may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party. In such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Trials</h3>

  <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). MusicHub may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p>

  <p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.
  By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription
  on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we
  disclose to you in advance. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION
  BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE
  IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH MusicHub, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.</p>

  <h2>4 Payments, cancellations, and cooling off</h2>

  <h3>4.1 Billing</h3>

  <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from MusicHub or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the MusicHub Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).</p>

  <p>MusicHub may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the MusicHub Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p>

  <p>If you register for a Paid Subscription, you may change your mind for any or no reason and receive a full refund of all monies paid within fourteen (14) days starting from the day you sign-up for the relevant service (the “Cooling-off Period”) in accordance with the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the Cooling-off Period for the Paid
        Subscription for which you are receiving a Trial ends fourteen (14) days after
        you start the Trial. If you don’t cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial
        ends, you lose your right of withdrawal and authorize MusicHub to automatically charge
        you the agreed price each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you authorize MusicHub
        to charge you automatically each month until you cancel. You agree that the
        Cooling-off Period  is available for fourteen (14) days after your purchase but is
        lost once you use the MusicHub Service during that period.
       </p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.2 Renewal; Cancellation</h3>

  <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to MusicHub
  or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew
  at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before
  the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid
  Subscription through MusicHub, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party,
  by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party. The cancellation will take effect
  the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the
  Free Service. If you purchased your Paid Subscription through MusicHub and you cancel your payment
  or Paid Subscription and/or terminate any of the Agreements (1) after the Cooling-off Period is
  over (where applicable), or (2) before the end of the current subscription period, we will not
  refund any subscription fees already paid to us. If you wish to receive a full refund of all
  monies paid to MusicHub before the Cooling-off Period is over, you must contact Customer Support.
  When we process any refund, we will refund amounts using the method you used for payment.
  </p>

  <p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service. If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.</p>

Some Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by MusicHub (e.g. podcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content. The MusicHub Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.</p>

  <p>If you provide feedback, ideas, or suggestions to MusicHub in connection with the MusicHub Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize MusicHub to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.

  <h2>10 Infringement and reporting User Content</h2>

  <p>MusicHub respects the rights of intellectual property owners.

  or other rights, see>MusicHub’s copyright policy. If MusicHub is notified by a copyright holder, using the forms provided by MusicHub, that any Content infringes a copyright, MusicHub may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that MusicHub deems appropriate, without prior notification to the user or other party who supplied or posted that Content. If such user or other party believes that the Content is not infringing, he or she may in certain circumstances submit a counter-notification to MusicHub with a request to restore the removed content, which MusicHub may or may not honor, in MusicHub’s sole discretion.</p>

  <p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines,
  please fill out our notice form.</p>

  <h2>11 Service limitations and modifications</h2>

  <p>MusicHub will make reasonable efforts to keep the MusicHub Service operational. However, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. MusicHub reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the MusicHub Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for valid reasons such as in case of genuine interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the MusicHub Service or any function or feature thereof, or need to repair, maintain or improve the existing functions or features, or to add new functions or features to the Service, or to implement advancements in science and technology or ensure the operability or the security of the Service, legal and regulatory reasons.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to MusicHub for Paid Subscriptions that MusicHub permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments, cancellations, and cooling off section), MusicHub will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. You understand, agree, and accept that MusicHub will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service. MusicHub and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.  This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>12 Brand Accounts</h2>

  <p>If you establish a MusicHub account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand. If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.</p>

  <p>A Brand may follow users, create, and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement. In addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.</p>

  <h2>13 MusicHub Support Community</h2>

  <p>The MusicHub Support Community is a place for
  discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials
  related to the MusicHub Service. By using the MusicHub Support Community you
  agree to the Community Terms.</p>

  <h2>14 Customer support</h2>

  <p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions
  (“Customer Support Queries”), please submit a ticket to our Customer Service
  department using the Customer Service contact form
  on the About Us section of our website. We will use reasonable endeavours to respond
  to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises
  that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries.</p>

  <p>You can also file a complaint at the online platform for alternative dispute
  resolution (ODR-platform).  You can find the ODR-platform through the following
  link:  https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</p>

  <h2>15 Export control</h2>

  <p>MusicHub’s products may be subject to U.S. export and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State. You warrant that you are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions; and (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions.</p>

  <p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control
  laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained
  by OFAC, and the ITAR. Specifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or
  indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of
  any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on
  such technology) received from MusicHub under the Agreements to any destination,
  entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United
  States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the
  competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.</p>

  <h2>16 Term and termination</h2>

  <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you
  or MusicHub. However, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license
  granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable
  and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements
  for any reason. MusicHub may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to
  the MusicHub Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or
  suspected unauthorised use of the MusicHub Service and/or Content, non-compliance
  with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we
  shall provide you reasonable notice in advance of doing so). If you or MusicHub

  <h3>24.2 CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>

  <p>WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND MusicHub AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and MusicHub agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

  <h3>24.3 ARBITRATION</h3>

  <p>If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 24.3. is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:</p>

  <h4>24.3.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration</h4>

  <p>You and MusicHub agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and MusicHub arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with MusicHub as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p>

  <h4>24.3.2 Exceptions</h4>

  <p>Notwithstanding clause 24.3.1 above, you and MusicHub both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court ,(2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

  <h4>24.3.3 Arbitration rules</h4>

  <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and MusicHub will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) then in force (the “ICC Rules”) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.</p>

  <p>Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of [the relevant state or country listed in clause 24.1], without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.</p>

  <h4>24.3.4 Time for filing</h4>

  <p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>

  <h4>24.3.5 Notice; Process</h4>

  <p>
    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). MusicHub's address for Notice is: [MusicHub, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA]. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or MusicHub may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or MusicHub shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, MusicHub shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by MusicHub in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
    Except as required to enforce the arbitrator’s decision and award, neither you nor MusicHub shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.
  </p>

  <h4>24.3.6 Modifications</h4>

  <p>In the event that MusicHub makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to MusicHub's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to MusicHub's address for Notice, in which case your account with MusicHub shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.</p>

  <h4>24.3.7 Enforceability</h4>

  <p>If the class action waiver at Section 24.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this Section 24.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements.</p>
